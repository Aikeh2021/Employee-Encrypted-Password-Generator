## Introduction

So, you’ve finally got the job? Congratulations and welcome to the team! I bet you’re ready to dive headfirst into one of many career defining assignments. Before we can excel, we must first complete our employee onboarding paperwork.
The only thing more exciting than your first paycheck, will be the process of completing forms with the unique government-assigned identifiers you’ve been using since birth. Afterwards, we can sit through a week’s worth of protocol meetings, stale scenario re-enactments, and then take quizzes on all of the new information you just saw *ten minutes ago*. Doesn’t this sound great!

That being said, one of the hardest steps in this process involves creating the login information you use to access your employee portal. Back in the day, companies often did this for you. However, being that you now work for a more progressive company, we’ll let you take on this daunting task by yourself! 
While usernames are often easy to create, passwords need a little more thought. Afterall, if a password is too simple, a hacker can easily access accounts and steal social security numbers, direct-deposit information, email and housing addresses, and much more. That’s where the Employee Encrypted Password Generator can be of service.

Let us create your password, so you can just worry about getting through the onboarding process!

I kept the website design simple to provide a smooth experience for the user. All you have to do is press the red button and choose from up to four criteria that you want your password to follow. Once you have finished, you’ll be presented with a unique password for use at your discretion. If only taxes were this easy!



## Installation

[Click here](https://aikeh2021.github.io/Employee-Encrypted-Password-Generator/) to have the link open in your webpage. Be sure to click the red “Generate Password” button when you’re ready to get started. Don’t forget to bring a pen and paper to write the password down for use later (assuming you’re not using a personal device).

## Style

The design of this website is very simple! The red button seemed like a the right choice to draw the user’s eye directly to where they should be interacting with the page. Being that there are no instructions included on the initial website, it’s important the user can easily see where to get started. After the user has started the generator, they need only answer a few questions before being shown their password in bold and easy to read text. The usability is so direct this site could be useful to people of any age and any skill level.

## New Methods and Roadblocks

I can definitely say my new study methods are greatly helping with my understanding of the past material. 
Unfortunately, I have hit another roadblock. My new method, though effective, is quite time consuming. In addition, I find it has not been so helpful with the current unit. I don't understand what I am doing and I am stumped on how to move forward. 
I think I don't understand a lot of the terms being used in class and it's hindering my understanding because I have a hard time implementing ideas and terms I have never seen before. Not to mention, the volume of new concepts is large and one day of review on my own between classes is not enough for me to understand. I need to find a new way to understand the material so I don't fall further behind. 
I think I am going to revisit this homework and keep working on it on my personal device's visual studio code. I sometimes find that time and repetition are what I need to make the material click. I find that sometimes walking away from an assignment and looking at it after some time off, helps me see an issue with new eyes. And during my break, I review and Google things I didn't understand so that I'm still improving my knowledge while I'm away. In this instance, I wasn't even able to begin the javascript because I keep getting caught up in the names of the terms and what each thing does. After a few days of trying, I didn't know what to do anymore. 
I hope that eventually I will be able to get my code to work especially since I know I will have to use it again in the future. 

## After Some Time . . .

Sometimes time does heal all wounds. All puns aside, after some time the reviews of vanilla javascript began to solidify in my memory. In addition to my Google abilities and improved study methods, I have finally started to get a better grasp on how to complete this actitivity. I may revisit in the future to see if I can apply a switch case to reduce some of the repetition in the code. But for now the code works and I am pleased.
