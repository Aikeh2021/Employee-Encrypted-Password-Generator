## Introduction

So, you’ve finally got the job? Congratulations and welcome to the team! I bet you’re ready to dive headfirst into one of many career defining assignments. Before we can excel, we must first complete our employee onboarding paperwork.
The only thing more exciting than your first paycheck, will be the process of completing forms with the unique government-assigned identifiers you’ve been using since birth. Afterwards, we can sit through a week’s worth of protocol meetings, stale scenario re-enactments, and then take quizzes on all of the new information you just saw *ten minutes ago*. Doesn’t this sound great!

That being said, one of the hardest steps in this process involves creating the login information you use to access your employee portal. Back in the day, companies often did this for you. However, being that you now work for a more progressive company, we’ll let you take on this daunting task by yourself! 
While usernames are often easy to create, passwords need a little more thought. Afterall, if a password is too simple, a hacker can easily access accounts and steal social security numbers, direct-deposit information, email and housing addresses, and much more. That’s where the Employee Encrypted Password Generator can be of service.

Let us create your password, so you can just worry about getting through the onboarding process!

I kept the website design simple to provide a smooth experience for the user. All you have to do is press the red button and give the website the parameters you want your password to follow. Once you have finished, you’ll be presented with your new password. If only taxes were this easy!
